- v6.17.1 December 4, 2012
	- Updated misc internals to use the new `File::getOutContent` call

- v6.17.0 December 4, 2012
	- Cleaned up the way we handle buffers, data, and meta data - more effecient and simpler api
	- Updated
		- `File::getMeta` to create meta if it doesn't exist yet
	- Removed
		-  `Document::initialize` didn't do anything
		-  `Document::getMeta` didn't do anything
		-  `File::readFile` merged into `File::parse`
		- `File::parseData` renamed to `File::parse` and cleaned signficantly
	- Added
		- `Base::setDefaults` to update attributes that haven't been set
		- `File::setMeta` to update the meta more easily than `File.getMeta().set`
		- `File::setMetaDefaults` to update the meta attributes that haven't been set

		- `File::getOutContent` to get the rendered content, or content, or buffer
		- `File::getStat` to get the stat
		- `File::setBuffer` to set the buffer
		- `File::getBuffer` to get the buffer

- v6.16.0 December 4, 2012
	- The amount of render passes is now customisable via the `renderPasses` configuration option, defaults to `1`
		- Increment this value dependening on how many levels of cross-document references you have (e.g. 2 passes for C includes B, B includes A)
	- The render pass functionality has been changed to render all documents that don't reference anything else first, then for each additional render pass, render documents that do reference others
		- Previously it would render both types of documents in the one batch, which resulted in hit and miss results
		- Doing this, we now safely have the default `renderPasses` value set to `1` which has the same effect as the traditional `2` render pass
		- Refer to [issue #359](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/359) for more information

		- Updated [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) from v2.5 to v3.0
			- If you're doing custom routing, you'll want to check the [Express.js Upgrade Guide](https://github.com/visionmedia/express/wiki/Migrating-from-2.x-to-3.x)
			- There are now two server objects: `serverExpress` and `serverHttp` - get them using `docpadInstance.getServer(true)`, set them using `docpad.setServer({serverExpress,serverHttp})` - `server` in events, and `docpadInstance.getServer()` return the `serverExpress` object for backwards compatibility (however things like socket.io require the `serverHttp` object)
			- Closes [#311](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/pull/311), [#308](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/308), [#272](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/272), [#274](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/274)
			- Help by [dave8401](https://github.com/dave8401) and [Ben Harris](https://github.com/bharrisau)
		- Abstracted out the different middlewares to `serverMiddlewareHeader`, `serverMiddlewareRouter`, `serverMiddleware404`, and `serverMiddleware500`
		- Added the following options to the `server` actions:
			- `serverExpress` for a custom express.js server
			- `serverHttp` for a custom http server
			- `middlewareStandard` set it to `false` for us to not use any of the standard middleware (body parse, method override, express router)
			- `middlewareBodyParser` set it to `false` for us to not add the `bodyParser` middleware
			- `middlewareMethodOverride` set it to `false` for us to not add the `methodOverride` middleware
			- `middlewareExpressRouter` set it to `false` for us to not add the Express.js `router` middleware
			- `middleware404` set it to `false` for us to not add our `404` middleware
			- `middleware500` set it to `false` for us to not add our `500` middleware
		- Example API usage can be found [here](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/wiki/API)
	- Added `standalone` attribute to files (defaults to `false`)
		- If you set to `true`, changes to the file will only cause re-rendering of that file alone
	- Added a progress indicator during generation
		- Closes [#247](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/247)

	- Will now ask if you would like to subscribe to our newsletter when running on the development environment
	- Beginnings of localisation

- v6.5.7 August 26, 2012
	- Fixed "cannot get length of undefined" intermittent error
		- Due to an incorret variable name inside `DocPad::ensureDocumentOrFile`

- v6.5.6 August 19, 2012
	- Added `regenerateEvery` configuration option

- v6.5.0-6.5.5 August 10, 2012
	- IMPORTANT: Renamed `extensionRendered` to `outExtension`, `filenameRendered` to `outFilename`, and `contentTypeRendered` to `outContentType` and moved them from the Document model to the File model
	- The `serverExtend` event will now also emit the `express` dependency if used
	- No longer attempts to install plugins dependencies every time, this is outside the scope of DocPad and in the standard use cases already handled via npm
	- No longer accepts `npmPath`, `gitPath`, and `nodePath` as configuration options, instead these should be environment variables at `NPM_PATH`, `GIT_PATH`, and `NODE_PATH` respectively (without the underscore is also acceptable)
	- Eliminated ambiguity with `renderSingleExtensions`
		- if `true` it will render `markdown`, `.md` and `example.md`
		- if `'auto'` it will render `markdown` but not `.md` and `example.md`
		- `auto` is now used on the `docpad render` command
	- Can now specify a custom configuration file vis the command line using `-c, --config <configPath>`
	- Can now specify a custom outPath via the command line using `-o, --out <outPath>`
	- Can now set template data via `req.templateData`
	- Can now customise the action that the `docpad-server` executable performs by setting the `DOCPAD_SERVER_ACTION` environment variable
	- Fixed `Document::writeSource`

	- Fixed `no readme` npm warning
		- Removed markdown files from `.npmignore` as they are now required for the new npm website listing

		- Added a new `stylesheet` collection that contains any stylesheet file (including pre-processors) and sets their `referenceOthers` property to `true`
	- Fixed `contextualizeBefore` and `contextualizeAfter` events not firing
		- Thanks to [Bruno Héridet](https://github.com/Delapouite) for [pull request #277](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/pull/277)
	- Fixed `contentType` being looked up twice
		- Thanks to [Nick Crohn](https://github.com/ncrohn) for [pull request #273](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/pull/273)

- v6.4.1 July 19, 2012
	- Added new `source` attribute to the file model, as the `content` attribute on the document model is actually the `body` not the original content like it is in the file model

- v6.4.0 July 19, 2012
	- We now support `404 Not Found` and `500 Internal Server Error` error pages thanks to [Nick Crohn](https://github.com/ncrohn) for [pull request #251](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/pull/251)
	- Fixed [#269](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/269) where the `docpad render` command wouldn't work
	- Fixed [#268](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/issues/268) where files which names start with a `.` from having a `.` appended to their output filename

- v6.3.3 July 18, 2012
	- Fixed binary file output
		- Added binary files to the test suite so this won't happen again
		- Was due to the dereference on the new clear introduced in v6.3.0
			- As such, we now store the `data` attribute for files outside of the attributes, use `getData` and `setData(data)` now instead of `get('data')` and `set({data:data})`

- v6.3.2 July 18, 2012
	- Fixed install action

- v6.3.1 July 18, 2012
	- Fixed `extendCollections` being called before the plugins have loaded when using the CLI

- v6.3.0 July 18, 2012
	- Added support for multiple environments
	- Top-level configuration assumed to reflect the production environment, other environments will extend from it
		- This is because getting a production environment configuration inside your development environment is fine, however getting a development environment configuration inside your production environment is catastrophic - as such, having the top-level configuration reflect the production environment handles this assumption correctly
	- Added environment configuration support to plugins and their configuration
	- Removed `package.json > docpad > plugin` configuration mode for a plugin's `package.json`, they should use the `config` property in their class instead
	- Added `isEnabled()` to the plugin class, this reflects the `enabled` property in the plugin configuration, if it is false, then no events are executed for that plugin
	- Killed the `docpad cli` action, no one used it and introduced a lot of complexity to the codebase
	- Added `populateCollections` event, use this to insert things into our collections and blocks
	- Added `docpadLoaded` event which fires whenever our configuration is re-loaded
	- Added support for overriding the `extension` attribute via your document's meta data
	- Added support for the `renderSingleExtensions` attribute in documents
	- Fixed `clean` action from not behaving as expected
		- Had the wrong indexOf indice value in the check
	- Fixed default attributes not being kept inside document and file attributes when cleared
		- Turns out Backbone's `Mode::clear()` wipes everything, rather than reset to the default attributes and values

- v6.2.0 July 10, 2012
	- Dropped node v0.4 support
		- Minimum required version is now 0.6
	- Dropped `npm` dependency
	- Configuration merging now deep extends plain javascript objects
	- Added environment specific configuration support
		- By default we use `process.env.NODE_ENV` for the environment, falling back to `development`
		- Specify your environment specific configuration in `environments[env]`
		- By default, our production environment sets `maxAge` to one day, and `checkVersion` to false
		- Use `getEnvironment` to get the current environment
	- Added new `extendCollections` event
	- Added check during clean action to ensure we don't remove outPath if it is higher than our rootPath
	- Added `docpad-server` binary to shortcut heroku deployment
	- Scripts collection now supports adding plaintext javascript
	- `consoleSetup` options are now `consoleInterface` and `commander` instead of `interface` and `program`
	- DocPad's main file is now `out/main.coffee` and the exported `require` is now limited to files in the `out` directory (not higher)

- v6.1.3 July 8, 2012
	- Fixed `extendTemplateData` event firing before our plugins have finished loading

	- End user changes
		- Added suport for using no skeleton on empty directory
		- Action completion callback will now correctly return all arugments instead of just the error argument
		- Filename argument on command line is now optional, if specified it now supports single extension values, e.g. `markdown` instead of `file.html.md`
		- When using CoffeeScript intead of YAML for meta data headers, the CoffeeScript will now be sandboxed
			- If you are wanting to get stuff outside the sandbox write a `docpad.coffee` configuration file
	- Document and File model changes
		- Now work fine without any path specified
		- `render` split into `renderExtensions`, `renderDocument` and `renderLayout`
		- `renderExtensions` now supports the option `renderSingleExtensions` when specified, will prepend the extension `null`, allowing supported plugins to render single extensions
		- `render` now supports the option `actions` which is an array of actions to perform
		- we now do not clear the `contentRendered`, `contentRenderedWithoutLayouts`, and `rendered` properties between render passes

- v6.0.6 June 19, 2012
	- Greatly simplified the event architecture
		- We now inherit from the simpler `balUtil.EventEmitterEnhanced` instead of `balUtil.EventSystem`, and have moved queue code into `balUtil.Group` as `docpadInstance.getRunner()`

		- Added automated regression tests to ensure this will never happen again
	- Added `documentsPaths`, `filesPaths`, and `layoutsPaths` configuration variables
	- Simplified model code
	- Cleaned up some async code

- v5.2.0 May 4, 2012
	- We now pre-compile our CoffeeScript
	- Added the ability to specify a `docpad.cson` configuration file inside your website
		- This file will also be watched for changes, and if a change is made, we'll reload it and regenerate :)
	- Database/Collections have been cleaned up
		- files, layouts and documents are all added to the database
		- documents and layouts are represented by the `Document` model which extends the `File` model
		- files are represented by the `File` model
		- documents are accessible via the `collections.documents` which is a live child collection of database
		- files are accessible via the `collections.files` which is a live child collection of database
		- layouts are accessible via the `collections.layouts` which is a live child collection of database
	- You can create your own live child collections by specifying them in your configuration file, e.g. add this to your `docpad.cson` file:
		``` coffee
		# Collections
		collections:
			pages: (database) ->
				database.findAll(pageOrder: $exists: true)
			posts: (database) ->
				database.findAll(tags: $has: 'post')
		```
	- Templates now have access to a new function called `include`. It will include the renderedContent (or if unavilable to content) of the file. In eco, you would use it like this: `<%- @include('filename.ext1.ext2.ext3') %>`
	- Blocks are now Collections too! You can call `.add` on them, and use `.toHTML()` to grab them as HTML (`.join` will do the same thing for b/c)
	- This should be a completely backwards compatible release, let us know if you any issues on the

- v5.1.2 April 26, 2012

	- Upgraded [Query-Engine](https://github.com/bevry/query-engine) version from 0.6 to 1.1
	- Plugins are now managed by npm and are no longer bundled with DocPad
		- You will need to add them to your website's `package.json` and install them via `npm install docpad-plugin-#{pluginName}`
		- We now scan the `node_modules` and `plugins` directories of your website for docpad plugins
			- These paths can be customised via the `pluginsPaths` variable in the docpad configuration
		- DocPad detects if something is a plugin by checking for the `docpad-plugin` keyword in the `package.json` file, or if the file follows the `#{pluginName}.plugin.coffee` naming convention
	- CoffeeScript dependency is now bundled inside, instead of being an external dependency
	- A website's npm dependencies are now installed as part of the initialisation process
	- This is a big backwards compatibility break, previous skeletons and plugins need to upgraded

	- Added support for caching and parsing remote feeds, with the new [Feedr Plugin](https://github.com/bevry/docpad/tree/master/lib/exchange/plugins/feedr)
	- Added support for independent plugin unit tests
	- Added support for specifying `templateData` for the docpad configuration
	- Skeletons are no longer cached
		- Caching skeletons was causing far too many problems
	- Will now always use the local npm installation
	- Added `gitPath` and `nodePath` to docpad configuration
	- Split a document's `title` into `title` and `name`
		- Use `title` for page titles (e.g. `<title>page title</title>`)
		- Use `name` for navigation listings
		- This was introduced as sometimes you want a different title for your page title, than for your navigation page names
	- Cleaned up the plugin event system
		- Got rid of `triggerPluginEvent` and now we use [balUtil's](https://github.com/balupton/bal-util.npm) [emitSync](https://github.com/balupton/bal-util.npm/blob/master/lib/events.coffee#L257) and [emitAsync](https://github.com/balupton/bal-util.npm/blob/master/lib/events.coffee#L241)
		- This for the time being, also remove the use of plugin priorities. We suggest keeping your priorities in there, in the case that we re-introduce the functionality in the future.
	- When an error occurs we will send an error report back to DocPad using [AirBrake](http://airbrake.io/)
		- To turn this off, set `reportErrors` in your docpad configuration to `false`
	- Files, Documents, Layouts and Partials are now proper "models" and are now found in the `lib/models` directory
	- Moved out some unstable or not as popular plugins to the [docpad-extras](https://github.com/bevry/docpad-extras) repository, plugins moved are:
		- Admin
		- Authenticate

	- The `enabledPlugins` config option will now correctly only overwrite the default values if you have set it to be a string
		- Before it would always incorrectly overwrite the default value if set, which would cause some experimental disabled-by-default plugins to enable
	- Added a [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) Syntax Highlighting plugin
		- It is disabled by default as not everyone would want syntax highlighting, to enable it, add the following to your website's `package.json` file:
			``` javascript
			"docpad": {
				"enabledPlugins": {
					"pygments": true
				}
			}
			```
		- Thanks to [Doug Neiner](https://github.com/dcneiner) for urging it along

		- Enabled by default

- v2.3 November 18, 2011
	- [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) server support
	- Added `extendServer` configuration option
		- Now, by default, even if the server is provided, we will extend it. If you do not want this, set this configuration option to `false`.

		- `title` if now set to `filenameRendered` if not set
	- Added support for different meta parsers, starting with [CoffeeScript](http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/) and [YAML](https://github.com/visionmedia/js-yaml) support. YAML is still the default meta parser
